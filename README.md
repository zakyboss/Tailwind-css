     Or In other word ðŸ¤“
     Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined classes that can be used to style web applications. Instead of writing custom CSS from scratch, Tailwind encourages developers to compose styles by applying utility classes directly to HTML elements.
Some key features and benefits of Tailwind CSS include:

Utility-first Approach: Tailwind provides a comprehensive library of low-level utility classes like text-gray-500, bg-blue-600, font-bold, etc. that can be combined to quickly style components.
Responsive Design: Tailwind's utility classes include responsive variants, allowing you to easily apply different styles based on screen size without having to write media queries.
Consistency: By using a consistent set of utility classes, Tailwind helps maintain a cohesive design system and visual unity across an application.
Customization: Tailwind can be configured and extended to match the design requirements of your project, including creating custom utility classes.
Smaller File Sizes: Since Tailwind only includes the styles you use, it can result in smaller final CSS file sizes compared to traditional CSS frameworks.

Overall, Tailwind CSS promotes a functional, component-driven approach to styling web applications. It can improve development speed and consistency, making it a popular choice for React, Vue, and other modern frontend frameworks
